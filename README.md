# Kölsch-French Lexical Heritage Project

A digital homage (and love letter) to the linguistic liaison between Kölsch and French. This project presents a collection of words revealing the French influence on the Kölsch dialect. Content is for now only available in German (with sprinkels of Kölsch), and partly in French. 

It is made possible thanks to the foundational work of Adam Wrede's **"Neuen Kölnischen Wortschatz"**, which served as the primary source for collecting French-origin words still alive or remembered in Kölsch today.


## About

This project dives into the rich lexical heritage shaped by the French occupation of Cologne (1794–1814) and beyond. 

Explore detailed word cards, interactive learning games, and a visual word network that maps the fascinating connections between these two languages.

- Test your knowledge with interactive flashcards
